# MATLAB Pulseq ↔ MR-zero Integration Guide

This guide shows how to seamlessly integrate MATLAB Pulseq with Python MR-zero for powerful sequence development and simulation workflows.

## **Quick Start for MATLAB Users**

**Already have MATLAB Pulseq sequences?** Get started in 3 steps:

1. **Export your sequence**: `seq.write('my_sequence.seq')` in MATLAB
2. **Upload to Colab**: Use our [file upload example](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MRsources/MRzero-Core/blob/main/documentation/playground_mr0/mr0_upload_seq.ipynb)
3. **Simulate instantly**: No Python installation required!

## **Integration Workflows**

### **Workflow 1: MATLAB seq creation → Python Simulation**

**Use Case**: Leverage MR-zero's fast simulation while keeping your MATLAB development workflow

```matlab
% In MATLAB: Create your sequence as usual
seq = mr.Sequence();
% ... build your sequence ...
seq.write('my_flash.seq');
```
Then switch to python and load the seq file.
    
```python
# In Python/Colab: Simulate with one line
import MRzeroCore as mr0
seq = mr0.Sequence.import_file('my_flash.seq')
signal = mr0.util.simulate(seq)
```

You can just upload your seq file in [![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MRsources/MRzero-Core/blob/main/documentation/playground_mr0/mr0_upload_seq.ipynb)

### **Workflow 2: MATLAB seq creation → Call Python from Matlab using sys command**
