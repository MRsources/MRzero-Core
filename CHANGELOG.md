- 0.2.11
  - (re-)introduced return_mag_z parameter in pdg simulation
- 0.2.10
  - change default FOV in all notebooks to phantom size (200 mm)
  - Use Open in Colab badges in the playground instead of links
  - Documented how to run on GPU
  - Added another pure mr0 flash DWI sequence to the playground
  - Bugfix: normalized_grads setting was not passed in Sequence.cuda() and .cpu()
  - Bugfix: removed wrong 2*pi factor from Diffusion b-value calculations
- 0.2.9
  - Change sign in gradient simulation - flips orientation of old reconstructions
  - Included util file in mr0
  - Improved plot function to support pypulseq 1.4.0-dev
  - Add util to documentation
- 0.2.8
  - Updated playground notebook to use new FOV definitions
  - Fixed SimData.recover()
- 0.2.7
  - Removed perlin-numpy from dependencies (git dependency not allowed by pypi)
- 0.2.6
  - New pulseq importer (correctly implements 1.2 - 1.4 spec)
  - FOV / phantom size now in SI units per default
  - Normalized gradients (when defining sequences in mr0) is now an explicit sequence flag
