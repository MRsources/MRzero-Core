- 0.3.1
  - WIP .dsv support with pydisseqt 0.1.5
  - changed type annotation in util.imshow for python 3.9 compatibility
- 0.3.0
  - Bugfixes (seq.get_contrast(), pTx shim phase, pytorch deprecation warnings, > 360° pulses, pulseq plot, missing 2pi in diffusion, phantom plot titles)
  - WIP rigid phantom motion simulation - not yet documented and subject to change
  - Added option to return transversal magnetization from simulation
  - New imshow() function in util.py for consistent plotting
  - Some fixes to playground sequences - bigger overhaul coming soon
  - Allow loading B0 / B1 in new VoxelGridPhantom.load() function
  - Introduced quantified brain
  - Performance improvement - only calculate signal for measured ADC samples
  - Added latent_signal_unormalized to prepass graph for vizualisation
- 0.2.12
  - Fixed Brainweb phantom loading and generation
  - Switched pre-pass kt precision from f32 to f64
  - Made pre-pass state merging relative to sequence gradient moment and event time sizes
- 0.2.11
  - (re-)introduced return_mag_z parameter in pdg simulation
- 0.2.10
  - change default FOV in all notebooks to phantom size (200 mm)
  - Use Open in Colab badges in the playground instead of links
  - Documented how to run on GPU
  - Added another pure mr0 flash DWI sequence to the playground
  - Bugfix: normalized_grads setting was not passed in Sequence.cuda() and .cpu()
  - Bugfix: removed wrong 2*pi factor from Diffusion b-value calculations
- 0.2.9
  - Change sign in gradient simulation - flips orientation of old reconstructions
  - Included util file in mr0
  - Improved plot function to support pypulseq 1.4.0-dev
  - Add util to documentation
- 0.2.8
  - Updated playground notebook to use new FOV definitions
  - Fixed SimData.recover()
- 0.2.7
  - Removed perlin-numpy from dependencies (git dependency not allowed by pypi)
- 0.2.6
  - New pulseq importer (correctly implements 1.2 - 1.4 spec)
  - FOV / phantom size now in SI units per default
  - Normalized gradients (when defining sequences in mr0) is now an explicit sequence flag
